# Erl-j's Soundfont Generator

Generate soundfonts from text descriptions using latent flow matching. You can then download the complete SFZ soundfont package to use the instrument locally.

## Instructions

1. Enter a text prompt to describe the audio you want to generate. For example, *"hard bass"* or *"dark analog lead flute flute flute soft"*.

2. Adjust the number of generation steps to tradeoff between quality and speed (kindof).

3. Click the "Generate Soundfont" button to generate the audio and soundfont.

4. Preview the generated instrument with the keyboard.

5. Export the soundfont by clicking the "Download SFZ Soundfont Package" button. You can then use the soundfont in a SFZ-compatible sampler. See [this list](https://sfzformat.com/software/players/) for a list of SFZ players.
